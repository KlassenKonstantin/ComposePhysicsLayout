# Physics Layout
![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.github.klassenkonstantin/physics-layout?style=flat-square&versionPrefix=0.4)

This library offers a [dyn4j](https://www.dyn4j.org) wrapper for [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).

## ðŸš§ Experimental ðŸš§
Before reaching version 1.0, this library is considered experimental, which means that there is no guaranteed backwards compatibility between versions. Signatures, interfaces, names, etc. may and will most likely change.

## Sample App

# How to use
To get started, create a `PhysicsLayout` and add arbitrary content to it. Add the `physicsBody` modifier to Composables that should be part of the physics simulation.

## PhysicsLayout
```kotlin
@Composable
fun PhysicsLayout(
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    shape: Shape? = RectangleShape,
    scale: Dp = DEFAULT_SCALE,
    simulation: Simulation = rememberSimulation(),
    content: @Composable BoxScope.() -> Unit
)
```
- `shape`: The shape of the outer border of the `PhysicsLayout`
- `scale`: How many Dps should be considered one meter. Bodies shouldn't be smaller than one meter
- `simulation`: Does the mapping between layout and physics engine
- `content`: The arbitrary layout

## physicsBody modifier
```kotlin
fun Modifier.physicsBody(
    id: String? = null,
    shape: Shape = RectangleShape,
    bodyConfig: BodyConfig = BodyConfig(),
    dragConfig: DragConfig? = null,
)
```
- `id`: The id the body should have in the simulation. Useful for operations that act directly on bodies (not yet supported).
- `shape`: Describes the outer bounds of the body. Supported shapes are:
  - [RectangleShape](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/graphics/package-summary#RectangleShape())
  - [CircleShape](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/shape/package-summary#CircleShape())
  - [RoundedCornerShape](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/shape/RoundedCornerShape)
  - [CutCornerShape](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/shape/CutCornerShape)
- `bodyConfig`: Configures properties of the body
- `dragConfig`: Set a `DragConfig` to enable drag support, or `null` to disable dragging

## Clock
By default `Simulation` uses a default `Clock` which automatically starts running. To pause and resume a `Clock`, create an instance with `rememberClock()` and pass that to the `Simulation`.

### Example usage
```kotlin
@Composable
fun SimpleScreen() {
    Surface(
        modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(),
        color = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.background
    ) {
        PhysicsLayout {
            Card(
                modifier = Modifier.physicsBody(
                    shape = CircleShape,
                ).align(Alignment.Center),
                shape = CircleShape,
            ) {
                Icon(
                    modifier = Modifier
                        .size(32.dp)
                        .padding(4.dp),
                    imageVector = Icons.Default.Star,
                    contentDescription = "Star",
                    tint = Color.White
                )
            }
        }
    }
}
```
This example adds a ball with a star in the center of the layout, which then starts falling to the ground.

> Note: The `shape` must be set on both the body modifier and the `Card`.

### Change gravity
If you need to change the gravity of the simulated world, use `Simulation.setGravity`

## Caveats, notes, missing features
- I don't think Compose was made to display hundrets of Composables at the same time. So maybe it's not a good idea to build a particle system out of this.
- In general, what is true for all of Compose is especially true for this Layout: **Release builds perform way better than debug builds**.
- State is not restored on config changes ðŸ˜±.
- Currently there is no way to observe bodies / collosions / etc.
- Not tested with scrolling containers
