# Physics Layout
![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.github.klassenkonstantin/physics-layout?style=flat-square&versionPrefix=0.1)

This library offsers a custom [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) layout that is backed by some physics engine. Currently it is powered by and tightly coupled with [dyn4j](https://www.dyn4j.org).

## How to use (ðŸš§)
To get started (and to be honest, there is not much you can currently do after you got started) create a `PhysicsLayout` and fill it with Composables. Every root level Composable in `PhysicsLayout` must use the `body` modifier to tell the simulation how the Composable behaves in the physics world. The `body` modifier can be configured with following parameters:
- `id`: The id the body should have in the simulation. Useful for operations that act directly on bodies (not yet supported).
- `shape`: Describes the outer bounds of the body. Only [RoundedCornerShape](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/shape/RoundedCornerShape)s are supported.
- `isStatic`: Set true for unmovable bodies like walls and floors.
- `initialTranslation`: Where this body should be placed in the layout. An `Offset` of (0,0) is the center of the layout, not top left.
- `initialImpulse`: The impulse that should be applied to this body once it's placed into the world

`PhysicsLayout` takes a `Simulation` as a parameter. Use `rememberSimulation` to create a Simulation. `rememberSimulation` is used as the default argument for `simulation`.

### Example usage
```kotlin
PhysicsLayout {
    Card(
        modifier = Modifier.body(
            shape = CircleShape,
        ),
        shape = CircleShape,
    ) {
        Icon(
            modifier = Modifier
                .size(32.dp)
                .padding(4.dp),
            imageVector = Icons.Default.Star,
            contentDescription = "Star",
            tint = Color.White
        )
    }
}
```
This would add a ball with a star in the center of the layout, which then starts falling to the ground.

> Note: The `shape` must be set on both the body modifier and the `Card`.

### Change gravity
If you need to change the gravity of the simulated world, use `Simulation.setGravity`

## Caveats, notes, missing features
- I don't think Compose was made to display hundrets of Composables at the same time. So maybe it's not a good idea to build a particle system out of this.
- In general, what is true for all of Compose is especially true for this Layout: **Release builds perform way better than debug builds**.
- State is not restored on config changes ðŸ˜±.
- Currently there is no way to interact with the bodies.
- Currently there is no way to observe bodies / collosions / etc.
