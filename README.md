# Physics Layout
![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.github.klassenkonstantin/physics-layout?style=flat-square&versionPrefix=0.3)

This library offers a [dyn4j](https://www.dyn4j.org) wrapper for [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose).

## ðŸš§ Experimental ðŸš§
Before reaching version 1.0, this library is considered experimental, which means that there is no guaranteed backwards compatibility between versions. Signatures, interfaces, names, etc. may and will most likely change.

# How to use
To get started, create a `PhysicsLayout` and fill it with Composables. Every root level Composable in `PhysicsLayout` must use the `body` modifier to tell the simulation how the Composable should behave in the physics world.

## PhysicsLayout
```kotlin
@Composable
fun PhysicsLayout(
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    simulation: Simulation = rememberSimulation(),
    onBodiesAdded: OnBodiesAdded? = null,
    shape: Shape? = RectangleShape,
    content: @Composable PhysicsLayoutScope.() -> Unit,
)
```
- `simulation`: Does the mapping between layout and physics engine
- `onBodiesAdded`: Called when the layout bodies composed in this layout are ready to be used
- `shape`: The shape of the outer border of the `PhysicsLayout`

## body modifier
```kotlin
fun Modifier.body(
    id: String? = null,
    shape: Shape = RectangleShape,
    isStatic: Boolean = false,
    initialTranslation: DpOffset = DpOffset.Zero,
    dragConfig: DragConfig = DragConfig.NotDraggable
): Modifier
```
- `id`: The id the body should have in the simulation. Useful for operations that act directly on bodies (not yet supported).
- `shape`: Describes the outer bounds of the body. Supported shapes are:
  - [RectangleShape](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/ui/graphics/package-summary#RectangleShape())
  - [CircleShape](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/shape/package-summary#CircleShape())
  - [RoundedCornerShape](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/shape/RoundedCornerShape)
  - [CutCornerShape](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/foundation/shape/CutCornerShape)
- `isStatic`: Set true for unmovable bodies like walls and floors.
- `initialTranslation`: Where this body should be placed in the layout. An `Offset` of (0,0) is the center of the layout, not top left.
- `dragConfig`: Set to `DragConfig.Draggable` to enable drag support

### Example usage
```kotlin
PhysicsLayout {
    Card(
        modifier = Modifier.body(
            shape = CircleShape,
        ),
        shape = CircleShape,
    ) {
        Icon(
            modifier = Modifier
                .size(32.dp)
                .padding(4.dp),
            imageVector = Icons.Default.Star,
            contentDescription = "Star",
            tint = Color.White
        )
    }
}
```
This would add a ball with a star in the center of the layout, which then starts falling to the ground.

> Note: The `shape` must be set on both the body modifier and the `Card`.

### Change gravity
If you need to change the gravity of the simulated world, use `Simulation.setGravity`

## Caveats, notes, missing features
- I don't think Compose was made to display hundrets of Composables at the same time. So maybe it's not a good idea to build a particle system out of this.
- In general, what is true for all of Compose is especially true for this Layout: **Release builds perform way better than debug builds**.
- State is not restored on config changes ðŸ˜±.
- Currently there is no way to observe bodies / collosions / etc.
